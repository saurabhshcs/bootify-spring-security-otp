# bootify-spring-security-otp

This application is discarded as I leveraged my existing application for JWT token based authentication. I have added an email api into that send successfully send that jwt token to the mentioned email and it works perfectly.

So please refer my another repo i.e. bootifyjpajwt

However I keep this repo for OTP generator API reference.

Many thanks
